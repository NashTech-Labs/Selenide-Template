# What is Selenide
Selenide is a framework for test automation powered by Selenium Webdriver. Everyone can prepare their own skeleton for writing automated test scripts using Selenide and it will be faster than preparing the same skeleton with Selenium.  It comes with powerful selectors, easy configuration, concise fluent API for tests, Ajax support for stable tests.

# Why Selenide?

To eliminate the persisting error points in the Selenium web driver, Selenide was introduced. It was introduced as a wrapper class for the Selenium WebDriver. With Selenide we can build testing scripts within the inbuilt assertions. For web applications, we typically write scripts that open the application in the web browser (either real or headless) and start clicking buttons. We call them user interface (UI) tests.

Selenide has been designed to be very easy usable from any IDE without the need for reading documentation. You just write $(“selector”). – and the IDE suggests all possible variants once you pressed the dot.
You can checkout and run it locally with a few minutes.
